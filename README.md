## _Algorand Sustainability Applications - Graduate_, Blockbeam

This four-weeks long program aimed to provide the students with a non-technical approach to sustainable decentralized applications on Algorand's ecosystem. Projects such as [CLIMATETRADE](https://climatetrade.com/), PokemonGo, [PlanetWatch](https://www.planetwatch.io/) and [Cudos](https://www.cudos.org/) were introduced. The last session involved a pitch night where my group and I pitched a project on a sustainable NFT marketplace on Algorand's ecosystem. This session recording can be found at [this](https://youtu.be/AMjaZI-dRxM?t=844) link.
